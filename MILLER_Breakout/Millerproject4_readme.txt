For this project I reskined a code I found through pygame. I included the link below. I wanted to make it a game in which the player is "spreading butter across bread". I first changed the art aspects of this. I made the bricks up top bread, and the moving ball a piece of butter. I also changed the main "bat" to be a butter knife in order to fit with the overall theme. I changed the font and background colors, as well as the message displayed when the game is over. I created my own sound with my mouth and linked it to the code. The last change I made was to the speed of the butter in line 48. The player can use their arrow keys to navigate the butter knife and bounce the butter off to hit the bread. The player has three lives before the game over screen appears. I was unable to get rid of the white boarder around the butter knife but it future development I plan to continue playing around with it in order to figure it out.
